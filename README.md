# Azure Exam 532 Study Guide
Preparing for an exam is much easier if you spend time studying the material instead of looking for it.  While doing my preparation, I went through tons of videos, Microsoft Azure documentation, blogs etc.  All along, I kept a journal of what I found informative and here sharing the study material that helped me pass the exam. 

Originally, I took my notes in OneNote and I have exported the content in two formats: 'Html' and 'Pdf'.  Both formats are available to download. 

Happy Learning :)


### Please note, 
this study guide is a combination of my own interpretation and informative material that I found in blogs/videos/Articles.
