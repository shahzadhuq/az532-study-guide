# Azure Exam 532 Study Guide
Preparing for an exam is much easier if you spend time studying the material instead of looking for it.  While doing my preparation, I went through tons of videos, Microsoft Azure documentation, blogs etc.  All along, I kept a journal of what I found informative and here sharing the study material that helped me pass the exam. 

Originally, I took my notes in OneNote and I have exported the content in two formats: 'Html' and 'Pdf'.  Both formats are available to download. 

Happy Learning :)


Some original sources for my study guide:
1. [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTpX4tZkYkw) to very good overview of all pieces involved in the exam 
2. [link](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/mcpexamprep/70-532-Developing-Microsoft-Azure-Solutions) includes additional topics relevant to exam 70-532; please know that some of the content does overlap with #1 above.
